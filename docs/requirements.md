# Clinical Web Extension Requirements

## 1. Overview
- **Purpose:** Browser extension that observes clinical/EMR web pages, derives clinical context, and uses OpenAI GPT-5 to provide prompt-driven insights/actions.
- **Primary Users:** Clinicians and informatics teams needing AI-assisted understanding of EMR content.
- **Value Proposition:** Rapidly adapt to varied EMR systems, capture on-screen context without EMR integration, enable configurable AI-driven workflows.

## 2. Goals and Non-Goals
- **Goals**
  - Support all modern desktop browsers via a single cross-browser extension codebase.
  - Detect page context (e.g., single patient, provider schedule) using available browser data with emphasis on DOM analysis.
  - Allow per-site prompt/customization collections persisted in browser storage.
  - Provide an in-page UI affordance to open configuration editors and display AI results.
  - Integrate directly with OpenAI GPT-5, handling PHI within requests securely.
- **Non-Goals (Initial Release)**
  - Direct EMR API integrations or backend services besides OpenAI.
  - Mobile/tablet optimization beyond desktop browsers.
  - Multi-user sharing or server-side storage of prompt collections.

## 3. Supported Platforms & Compatibility
- **Browsers:** Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and other Chromium-based modern browsers; design for WebExtensions API parity.
- **Operating Systems:** Windows, macOS, Linux desktop environments.
- **EMR Targets:** Extension must be configurable to adapt to any EMR/web app; provide guidance for site-specific configuration.

## 4. High-Level Architecture
- **Extension Components:**
  - Background/service worker: manages lifecycle, messaging, storage sync, OpenAI API orchestration.
  - Content scripts: monitor DOM/URL changes, extract context signals, inject UI overlay/button.
  - Options/configuration UI: overlay/modal and console tools for editing prompt/customization collections.
- **Data Flow:**
  1. Content script observes page load/DOM mutations → extracts structured context features.
  2. Background worker aggregates context, selects applicable site customization/prompt.
  3. Prompt payload sent to OpenAI GPT-5 (including relevant DOM snippets and context metadata).
  4. Response delivered back to content script → rendered in UI overlay/console.
- **Modularity:** Isolation between context detectors, prompt templates, and AI service adapters to ease future extensions.

## 5. Context Detection Requirements
- **Inputs:** DOM tree, visible text, URL patterns, HTTP headers (if accessible), browser tab metadata.
- **Triggers:**
  - Initial run after `document.readyState === 'complete'`.
  - Subsequent runs on significant DOM mutations (MutationObserver with debouncing).
- **Outputs:** Structured context object (e.g., `{ patient: { present: boolean, identifier: string? }, providerSchedule: {...}, viewType: 'chart' | 'schedule' | ... }`).
- **Adaptability:** Provide configuration schema to map DOM selectors/patterns per site for context extraction.
- **Privacy Guardrails:** Minimize data captured to only necessary elements before transmission to OpenAI; support future redaction hooks.

## 6. Prompt & Customization Management
- **Storage:** Use browser storage APIs (prefer `browser.storage.local`) for persistence across sessions.
- **Organization:** Collections grouped per site domain/URL pattern; allow multiple prompts per workflow.
- **Editing Tools:**
  - Console-accessible commands for power users (initial release).
  - In-page overlay accessible via floating button for editing prompts/customizations.
- **Versioning:** Local-only version history (optional backlog item); no sharing between users initially.

## 7. OpenAI Integration
- **Model:** GPT-5 via OpenAI SDK (browser-compatible wrapper or secure background worker fetch).
- **Data Handling:** Assume PHI present; ensure encrypted transport (HTTPS), avoid logging sensitive payloads.
- **Configuration:** UI/console fields for API key entry and per-site prompt selection.
- **Rate/Cost Controls:** Provide configurable throttling and maximum token usage per request (document defaults).

## 8. UI/UX Requirements
- **Overlay Button:** Persistent but unobtrusive button injected into pages to open settings/response panel.
- **Response Presentation:** Start with console logging; roadmap to overlay panel with sections for detected context, AI suggestions, and prompt editing.
- **User Overrides:** Allow manual context override and prompt re-run from UI.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure button/panel keyboard navigable; respect high-contrast modes where possible.

## 9. Security, Privacy & Compliance
- Handle PHI compliant with HIPAA best practices:
  - Never persist PHI beyond browser storage; no remote logging.
  - Provide clear documentation for users regarding PHI handling and OpenAI data policies.
- Extension should function without elevated browser permissions beyond necessary host permissions.
- Document steps for managing API keys securely (e.g., not syncing via cloud storage unless user opts in).

## 10. Performance & Reliability
- **Response Time:** Target AI responses < 5 seconds; surface loading states.
- **Resource Usage:** DOM monitoring must be efficient (limit mutation observers to needed nodes, debounce API calls).
- **Offline Behavior:** Detect offline state; queue/suppress OpenAI calls with user notification.

## 11. Extensibility & Future Considerations
- Design abstraction layers for additional AI providers or local models (future).
- Plan for exporting/importing customization collections (JSON) to support sharing later.
- Include hooks for analytics/telemetry (disabled by default) respecting privacy constraints.

## 12. Documentation & Onboarding
- Provide setup guide: installation, granting permissions, entering OpenAI credentials.
- Author site-adaptation instructions covering DOM selector mapping and prompt tuning.
- Include troubleshooting section for common EMR layout issues and API errors.

## 13. Risks & Open Questions
- Variability in EMR DOM structures may complicate reliable context detection; consider fallback heuristics.
- Need legal review of PHI transmission to OpenAI GPT-5.
- Strategy for large DOM content chunking and prompt length management.
- Determine logging strategy for debugging without capturing PHI.
